    excerpt: "Exploring the shift towards AI-integrated frameworks and the rise of edge computing.",
    content: `
Web development is no longer just about writing code. In 2026, developers are becoming system designers.

AI-first frameworks now generate boilerplate, enforce best practices, and even suggest architecture decisions. Edge computing has reduced latency to near zero, making global applications feel local.

The future frontend developer is part engineer, part designer, and part product thinker.

React apps in 2026 are no longer folder chaos.

Feature-based architecture dominates:
- components
- hooks
- services
- routes

This structure scales better, improves readability, and reduces cognitive load for teams.

Tailwind CSS is not just utility classes — it’s a mindset.

Using @apply, extracting UI primitives, and defining a strong design system can make Tailwind cleaner than traditional CSS.

Speed without discipline leads to mess. Discipline makes Tailwind powerful.
